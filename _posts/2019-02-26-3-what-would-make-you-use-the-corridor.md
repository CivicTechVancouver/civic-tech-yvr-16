* Knowing itâ€™s connected to the transit nodes without mayor interruptions
* Nudges inside <abbr title="autonomous vehicles">AVs</abbr> or [<abbr title="electric autonomous shuttle">ELA</abbr>](https://www.ridewithela.ca/) to increase social interaction among riders!! Get to know people in your community.
* More lively neighbourhood
  * Better / more interactive lighting?
* active transportation infrastructure
* If Iâ€™m tracking via app, Iâ€™d like to see how much emissions Iâ€™m saving. ðŸ™‚
  * Gamifying my positive contributions by using the corridor
* safer crosswalks
* a guided app tour
  * Iâ€™d like a historical tour
* consideration of illusion of safety that bright-dark contrast creates
  * c##e a##und increasing places where hazard can hide
* convenience and completeness
  * Donâ€™t do a short route with no destinations to save money or simplify.
* tracking, if people reach the outpatient centre from the hospital (beneficial to healthcare)
