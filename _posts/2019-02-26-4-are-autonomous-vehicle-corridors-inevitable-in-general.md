* No: What about considerations of material use for numerous sensors and global equity of resources.
  * Or: P####tion of <abbr title="human-powered vehicle">H.P.V.</abbr> as a service â€“ such as [Veemo](https://rideveemo.com/)
* Growing population density generates more traffic which can be optimized through autonomous regulation.
* It is transitional only. Separate corridors if needed, only short-term.
* If they can meet the need for simpler, slower local vehicle. faster, more efficient travel
* I think itâ€™s about using the current resources to the optimum and working upwards from there.
* Yes, but fully integrated and electric.
* Yes, but as trains. ðŸ™‚
* Shouldâ€™t that be a political consideration?
  * +1
* As long as the tech is affordable.
* No, need mixed, as least for people moving slower
  * smaller, lighter vehicle
* Corridors? No. Mixed traffic? probably
* Perhaps, but changes to <abbr title="autonomous vehicles">A/V</abbr> will not be done within a single generation. Itâ€™ll take longer to integrate.
* Yes, butâ€¦ what do we do with all the soon-to-be-useless parking space?
* As long as itâ€™s proven to solve defined problems
